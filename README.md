you should not be here. but since you are ill give you a hint: 
git clone
tar xvf
binwalk 
file
find value for:
                bs
                skip
                count
strings
xxd
find values for openssl: 
                       certificate format.
                       key format
strings key.x
Openssl extract pub key

here is the challenge: you have made it this far, let's see if you can keep going. 
if you can manage to extract the private key, I will give you the software used to flash the firmware
I will give you the software to generate your own .bin files. this software is inaccessible to the
public and is 2000$ a year for a liscence. if you can prove to me you know what your are doing I will send you the file. 

Instructions: whatsapp me at 1-917-744-1782 with the words "private key extracted"
              along with the file. I will compare the file, and if it is genuine I will send you back
              the software file. it is then up to you if you want to collaborate with me on some projects. 
              please don't sent bullshit fake keys and waste my time. I will be comparing it to be sure it is genuine. 

              happy hacking -6ix
